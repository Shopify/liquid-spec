description: "Core Liquid template engine behavior from Shopify/liquid"

default: true

hint: |
  These specs test core Liquid functionality from the reference implementation.
  Failures indicate missing or incorrect Liquid behavior.

# No required_features at suite level - allows JSON-RPC adapters to run
# Individual specs that need runtime drops declare required_features: [runtime_drops]

# Feature documentation:
# - :core includes :runtime_drops (full implementation)
# - JSON-RPC adapters that can't support runtime drops should declare features = []

defaults:
  render_errors: false

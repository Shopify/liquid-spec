# Shopify Theme Dawn Specs
# Real-world theme rendering from Shopify's Dawn starter theme

name: "Shopify Theme Dawn"
description: "Real-world Liquid templates from Shopify's Dawn starter theme"

# Included in default runs, but skipped if adapter doesn't implement shopify features
default: true

hint: |
  These specs require Shopify-specific Liquid tags and objects that are not part
  of the core Liquid library (e.g., {% schema %}, {% style %}, {% section %}, 
  section.blocks, content_for_header).
  
  To run these specs, your Liquid implementation must support Shopify theme tags.

# Required features for this suite
required_features:
  - core
  - shopify_tags        # {% schema %}, {% style %}, {% section %}, etc.
  - shopify_objects     # section, block, content_for_header, etc.
  - shopify_filters     # asset_url, image_url, etc.

# Default options applied to all specs
defaults:
  render_errors: false

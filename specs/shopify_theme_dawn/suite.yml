# Shopify Theme Dawn Specs
# Real-world theme rendering from Shopify's Dawn starter theme
#
# NOTE: These specs were recorded from Shopify's production Liquid implementation
# and require Shopify-internal features that are not available in the open-source
# Liquid gem. They are provided as reference specs for Shopify's internal testing.

name: "Shopify Theme Dawn"
description: "Real-world Liquid templates from Shopify's Dawn starter theme"

# Not included in default runs - requires Shopify's internal Liquid implementation
default: false

hint: |
  These specs require Shopify's internal Liquid implementation with:
  - Shopify-specific tags: {% schema %}, {% style %}, {% section %}, {% form %}, etc.
  - Shopify-specific objects: section, block, content_for_header, etc.
  - Shopify-specific filters: asset_url, image_url, t (translation), etc.
  - Dynamic {% render %} tag syntax not available in open-source Liquid
  
  The open-source Liquid gem cannot run these specs. They are provided for
  Shopify's internal testing infrastructure.

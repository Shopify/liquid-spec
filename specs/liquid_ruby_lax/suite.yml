# Liquid Ruby Lax Mode Specs
# Specs that require error_mode: :lax to parse invalid/quirky syntax

name: "Liquid Ruby (Lax Mode)"
description: "Specs that test lax parsing mode behavior - invalid syntax that lax mode tolerates"

# Included in default runs - lax mode is Liquid's default
default: true

hint: |
  These specs require error_mode: :lax to pass.
  Lax mode is a deprecated backwards-compatible parsing mode that tolerates invalid syntax.
  It exists for legacy Shopify templates but can be safely ignored by new implementations.
  If running in strict mode, these specs will fail with syntax errors.

# Required features for this suite
required_features:
  - core

# Default options - force lax mode for all specs

  error_mode: :lax

description: "Specs requiring error_mode: :lax for lenient parsing of invalid syntax"

default: true

hint: |
  These specs require error_mode: :lax to pass.
  Lax mode is a deprecated backwards-compatible parsing mode that tolerates invalid syntax.
  It exists for legacy Shopify templates but can be safely ignored by new implementations.

required_features:
  - lax_parsing

# Lax parsing is an advanced feature - implementations should focus on
# strict mode first before tackling lax compatibility
minimum_complexity: 500

defaults:
  error_mode: :lax
  render_errors: false

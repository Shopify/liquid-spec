Basic parsing specs:

  no transformation when no tags or outputs:
  - blah: blah
  - '': ''
  - TPL: this text should come out of the template without change...
    EXP: this text should come out of the template without change...
  - "<blah>": "<blah>"
  - TPL: |-
      this shouldnt see any transformation either but has multiple lines
                    as you can clearly see here ...
    EXP: |-
      this shouldnt see any transformation either but has multiple lines
                    as you can clearly see here ...
  - "|,.:": "|,.:"

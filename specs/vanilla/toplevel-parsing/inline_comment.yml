Inline comments:

  can be written on multiple lines:
  - TPL: |
      {%-
        # That kind of block comment is also allowed.
        # It would only be a stylistic difference.

        # Much like JavaScript's /* */ comments and their
        # leading * on new lines.
      -%}
    EXP: ''

  do not require a space after the pound sign:
  - "{%#this is an inline comment%}": ''

  do not support nested tags:
  - "{%- # {% echo 'hello world' %} -%}": " -%}"

  support this kind of block-ish style in a liquid tag:
  - TPL: |
      {%- liquid
        ######################################
        # We support comments like this too. #
        ######################################
      -%}
    EXP: ''

  return nothing:
  - "{%# this is an inline comment %}": ''
  - "{%-# this is an inline comment -%}": ''
  - "{% # this is an inline comment %}": ''
  - "{%- # this is an inline comment -%}": ''
  - TPL: |
      {%- liquid
        # This is how you'd write a block comment in a liquid tag.
        # It looks a lot like what you'd have in ruby.

        # You can use it as inline documentation in your
        # liquid blocks to explain why you're doing something.
        echo "Hey there, "

        # It won't affect the output.
        echo "how are you doing today?"
      -%}
    EXP: Hey there, how are you doing today?
  
  can trail other tags in general, although this is actually a quirk of tag parsing:
  - "{% echo 'hi' # a comment %}": {lax: "hi", strict: {fatal: true}}
